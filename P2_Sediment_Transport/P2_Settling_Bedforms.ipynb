Very small grains, when submerged in water, have a mass small enough that they reach a terminal velocity before any turbulence develops. This is true for clay- and silt-sized particles settling in water, and for these grain size classes Stokesâ€™ Law can be used to calculate the settling velocity as we worked out on the board in class:\n",
