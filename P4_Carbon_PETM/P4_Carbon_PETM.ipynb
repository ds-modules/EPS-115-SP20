    "## Question 4: Carbon fluxes associated with the PETM\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the reservoirs and fluxes of carbon is of central interest to biogeochemistry. Stable carbon isotope research has played an important role in constraining fluxes in and out of carbon reservoirs. In particular, carbon isotope records from marine carbonates are an important tool in understanding carbon cycling through time. Fractionation between inorganic carbon species is small while the fractionation between inorganic and biologic carbon is quite large (ca. -25 ‰), as the metabolic reduction of carbon strongly partitions $^{12}$C into organic matter. In the ocean, nearly all primary production and precipitation of carbonate occurs in the photic zone (surface ocean). Marine carbonates form in near equilibrium with the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the surface ocean and, since fractionation of stable C isotopes during carbonate precipitation is very small and not sensitive to temperature, the $\\delta^{13}$C values of ancient marine carbonates is taken to represent the $\\delta^{13}$C value of ancient surface DIC. A simple two box ocean carbon isotope isotope model illustrating the system is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C_boxmodel.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that the value of $\\delta^{13}C_{in}$ has been fixed through time at $\\sim$-6 ‰ and that the fractionation between inorganic and organic carbon $\\Delta$ has been fixed through time at $\\sim$-25 ‰. As we have discussed in class, we also know that when carbonate rocks form from inorganic carbon in the ocean they assume the isotopic value of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with minimal fractionation such that $\\delta^{13}$C$_{carbonate}$ = $\\delta^{13}$C$_{DIC}$. As we discussed in class, the typical ratio of organic to inorganic carbon burial makes it such that carbonates typically have a $\\delta^{13}C$ value of ~1‰.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, big fluxes of carbon into the system can perturb the steady-state that is shown in the figure above and can lead to changes in $\\delta^{13}C$ . One such event is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the Paleocene-Eocene boundary 56 million years ago, terrestrial and marine organisms experienced large shifts in geographic ranges, rapid evolution, and changes in trophic ecology. Synchronous with these changes was the extinction of benthic foraminifera species, ~5-8°C of global warming, extensive dissolution of deep-marine carbonates, and large excursions in the carbon isotopic composition ($\\delta^{13}C$) of marine carbonates."
